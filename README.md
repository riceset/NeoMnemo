<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>NeoMnemo, built upon Prettify, is a project I created during my studies of Japanese History. It functions as follows:</p><br>

- The front part acts as a prompt to recall events associated with a specific keyword. Initially, you attempt to write it down and then flip the card to verify your writing.
- Next, you endeavor to recall the mnemonic image or story linked to the event, which serves as a catalyst for remembering subsequent events.
- Ultimately, you can validate your recollection by reading the event's description.
